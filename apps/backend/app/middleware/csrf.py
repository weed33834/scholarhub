"""CSRF protection via the double-submit-cookie pattern.

When ``settings.csrf_enabled`` is True, every state-changing request
(POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE) targeting a non-API route must include an
``X-CSRF-Token`` header that matches the value of the ``csrf`` cookie.

We deliberately only enforce CSRF on cookie-authenticated endpoints
(``/api/auth/refresh``, ``/api/auth/logout``). Bearer-authenticated
endpoints are immune by design: there is no cookie to forge.

The middleware also issues the cookie if the client lacks one yet, so
a freshly loaded SPA can immediately use it for its first POST.

Mitigations to consider before relying on this for production:

* ``SameSite=Lax`` (default) already protects same-origin POSTs that
  originate from cross-origin GET contexts; double-submit is
  defence-in-depth for older browsers and cross-site POSTs.
* Sub-domains must NOT share an origin with the API or the cookie is
  trivially forged.
